Your mission is to destroy the red Nysses (busses) with projectiles so that you get score. 

The score is calculated by:
* 10 pts per Nysse
* n points per amount of passengers in the nysse

By clicking the game view there will appear radar for a couple of seconds that shows the areas passengers and nysses on the right side of GUI.
Radar takes in count also the passengers at the white stops in game view.
